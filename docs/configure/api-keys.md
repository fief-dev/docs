## Create a new API Key

To create a new API Key, click on the **Create API Key** button. A modal will open where you'll be able to input the name of the API Key. Choose a name that'll help you remember where and how it's used.

When you submit the form, a new modal will open with the actual **API key token**. For security reasons, it'll be shown **only once**. Copy and paste it somewhere safe before closing the modal.
