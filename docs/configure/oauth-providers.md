## Create a new OAuth Provider

You can create a new OAuth Provider by clicking the **Create OAuth Provider** button. A modal will open where you'll be able to input its different properties.

You can choose the **Provider** from the list of available providers, a custom name and [scopes](#scopes).

The most important part is the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**: it allows to uniquely identify *your* application on the OAuth Provider. That's why you need to "declare" it beforehand on their service. We provide [guidelines](#supported-oauth-providers) on how to create and configure a client on the OAuth Providers we support.

!!! tip "Don't forget to enable it on your tenant"
    OAuth Providers are enabled per tenant, so you can finely customize which authentication methods can be used on each one. To do so, [edit your tenant](./tenants.md#edit-an-existing-tenant) and enable the OAuth Provider.

## Edit an existing OAuth Provider

If you click on one of the OAuth Provider in the list, you'll see its details on the right and be able to change its properties.

## Delete an existing OAuth Provider

If one of your OAuth Provider is not useful anymore, you can delete it: click on the one you want to delete in the list and click on the **Delete** button.

![Delete OAuth Provider from admin dashboard](/assets/images/admin-oauth-providers-delete.png)

!!! danger "Associated OAuth accounts will be deleted as well"
    When you delete a provider, the **associated OAuth accounts** will be deleted as well. The associated users won't be deleted, but they will have to sign in with another method.

## Scopes

For each OAuth Providers you define, you'll be able to specify the list of **scopes** you want to ask when the user authenticates to the external service.

Those scopes tell the actions and data your application will be able to interact with on the external service API. For example, you might ask to get access to the Google Calendar of the user so your application can automatically add meetings to their agenda.

Each provider has its own list of scopes, corresponding to specific parts of the API.

!!! tip "Fief already asks for basic scopes"
    If you just want to authenticate users and nothing more, you can leave the scopes list empty. Fief takes care of asking for the scopes needed to authenticate the user and get their basic profile.
