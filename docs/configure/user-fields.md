!!! danger "Associated user values will be deleted as well"
    When you delete a user field, the **associated data on the user will also be deleted**. Make sure you don't need this information anymore or that you saved it somewhere else before proceeding.

## User field properties

User fields can be configured through their properties.

### Name

This is the name of your user field. It'll be used as **label in the registration form** and in the **admin dashboard**.

### Slug

This will be the **identifier of the field** in the [ID token](../getting-started/oauth2.md#access-token-and-id-token) and in API responses.

By default, it'll be automatically generated from the [name](#name), but you can customize it at will.

!!! tip "The slug is unique in an instance"
    Each field should have a unique identifier. If you try to create a new user field with a slug that already exists, an error will be raised.

### Type

This is probably the most important setting for your user field. It'll determine the **type of data you want to store**. We currently support n types:

#### String

Common type for textual values. Examples:

* A first or last name
* A company name
* A tagline

It'll be shown as a simple text input in forms.

#### Integer

Type to store integer values. Examples:

* A reputation score
* An height
* An age

It'll be shown as a numeric input in forms.

#### Boolean

Type to store boolean values. Examples:

* Subscription status to a newsletter
* Terms consent
* A validation status

It'll be shown as a checkbox in forms.

#### Choice

Type accepting a predefined set of values. Examples:

* A gender
* A job sector
* A level of experience

When selecting this type, you'll be able to configure the allowed choices.

Each choice consists of two things: the **value** (`A`), which is the actual underlying value that will be stored in database and returned in the user data, and the **label** (`Choice A`) which will be used to show a user-friendly label in forms and the admin dashboard.

It'll be shown as a select menu in forms.

#### Phone number

Type that'll validate if the value is a valid phone number. It shall be formatted with the international country code, `+331020405`.

It'll be shown as a text input in forms.

#### Address

Type that'll display several inputs to validate a full postal address.

#### Timezone

Type that'll display a list of valid timezones.

### Default

For some types, you can define a **default value**.

If the field is shown in a form, the field will automatically be pre-filled with this value.

If the field is not presented in a form, this value will be automatically assigned to new users when they register.

### Ask at registration

If checked, the user field will be presented in the **user registration form**.

### Ask at update

If checked, the user will be able to update its value through the `/profile` API.

!!! tip "Private field"
    In some cases, you need values that can't be set by the user, e.g., an onboarding status or a reputation score.

    To do this, you can simply uncheck both **Ask at registration** and **Ask at update** field.

    You'll always be able to update this value through the admin dashboard or the Admin API.

### Required

If checked, the value will have to be filled when presented in forms.

!!! tip "Required boolean field"
    You can set a user field of type [Boolean](#boolean) as **required**. In this case, the value **must be True**.

    It can be useful for consent checkbox where you need the user to accept the terms before creating its account.
