The left menu lets you access to the most important aspects of Fief:

* [Tenants](./tenants.md)
* [Clients](./clients.md)
* [OAuth Providers](./oauth-providers.md)
* [Users](./users.md)
* [User fields](./user-fields.md)
* [Access control](./access-control.md)
* [API Keys](./api-keys.md)

## Switch workspace

If your account is linked to several workspaces, you can switch to another workspace using the menu on the top-right.
