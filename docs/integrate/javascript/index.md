# JavaScript

We provide an official client for JavaScript. You can install it with `npm`:

```bash
npm install @fief/fief
```

## Create a `Fief` client

The Fief client provides all the necessary methods to manage OAuth2 authentication, validate access tokens and refresh them.

```js
const fief = new Fief({
  baseURL: 'https://fief.mydomain.com',  // (1)!
  clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',  // (2)!
  clientSecret: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET', // (3)!
});
```

1. **Base URL of your Fief tenant**

    You can find it in the admin dashboard, in the **Tenants** list. [More info](../../configure/tenants.md#base-url)
