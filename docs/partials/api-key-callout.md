!!! tip "What is an API key?"
    An API key is a secret token that'll allow you to make authenticated requests to the **Fief Admin API**.

    It'll be useful if you need, for example, to manage tenants or clients programmatically from your own application.

!!! warning "Keep it secret and safe"
    An API key gives **complete accesss** to your workspace data. Keep it somewhere safe and don't share it with anyone.
