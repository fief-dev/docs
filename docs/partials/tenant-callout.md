!!! tip "What is a tenant?"
    A tenant is a sub-division of your workspace. Each client and user is tied to a specific tenant.

    This is mostly useful if you want to create a product sold in white-label where each of your client has its own space. It allows for example for a user to have **several accounts with the same email address** inside one workspace, but actually tied to different tenants. From a user point-of-view, this is a different application on which they login with different credentials.

    If you don't plan to do this, that's okay: you'll always use a single tenant in your workspace.

    Each workspace has at least one default tenant.
