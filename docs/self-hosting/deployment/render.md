# Render

[Render](https://render.com/) is a very popular Platform as a Service (PaaS). It allows to quickly host and serve your applications without worrying about server management.

We provide an official blueprint creating all the services you need to run Fief.

## Before starting

1. If you don't have one yet, create an account on [Render](https://render.com).
2. Go to [https://dashboard.render.com/env-groups](https://dashboard.render.com/env-groups)
3. Create a **New Environment Group** and name it **fief** (all lowercase)

You can then proceed to the blueprint!

## Apply the blueprint

We provide variations for each **data center locations** supported by Fief. The best practice is to choose the one **closer to you and your users**.

Click on the links below to start creating the blueprint in the region of your choice:

## Fill the environment variables

We already set most of the environment variables, but you still have to set a few ones.

You can find the reference of those values in the [environment variables](../environment-variables.md) section.

## Set the custom domain

When the deployment is done, you need to link your domain with the `fief-server` service. Open the **Settings** of this service and in the **Custom Domains** section, add your domain.
