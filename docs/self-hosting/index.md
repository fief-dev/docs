# Self-hosting

Fief is a platform that you host for free on your own infrastructure.

In [Getting started](../getting-started/local-instance.md), we show you a way to easily start your instance locally. However, for production usage, we highly recommend you to perform a complete setup. We provide guides and blueprints to get you started on various **hosting technologies** and **cloud platforms**.
