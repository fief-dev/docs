!!! tip "What is an OAuth Provider?"
    An **OAuth Provider** is an external service allowing your users to quickly authenticate to your application by using their existing account on this service. If you used buttons like **Sign in with Google** or **Sign up with Facebook** before, you probably understand what it means!

    Basically, since most people already have an account on big social networks or websites like Google, Facebook, Discord or Microsoft, they can use it to sign in to your service without having to create yet another account with yet another password.

    With Fief, you can easily add those authentication methods to your instance. Corresponding buttons will be shown on the login and registration pages.
