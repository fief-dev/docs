After having created your user account, you'll be guided through the creation of your workspace . What is a workspace? A workspace is a place where all your Fief data lives: configuration, users data, etc. Each workspace has its own subdomain reserved for you, like https://example.fief.dev . If you are working on several projects or companies, we recommend to create several workspaces to keep things organized. Step 1: name your workspace The first step is to name your workspace. Use a name describing your application or company: it'll be used to generate your workspace subdomain. For example, a workspace named Bretagne Duchy will be assigned to the subdomain https://bretagne-duchy.fief.dev . Step 2: select your type of database One of the great strength of Fief is that you can bring your own database to store your workspace data. This way, you keep in total control of your data. Of course, we also propose you to store your data on our performand and secure cloud database. Your choice! At this step, you can make the choice between the Fief cloud database or configure your own. For the sake of simplicity, we'll choose here the cloud database . If you want to bring your own database, we recommend you to read the dedicated section . Ready to go! That's it! At this point, everything is ready to create your workspace!

Async support For asyncio enthusiasts, we also provide a FiefAsync class with the same methods. Perform an OAuth2 flow manually The simple script below shows you how to authenticate with OAuth2 \"manually\". The goal is to show you how to use the client. You'll then be able to integrate it in your own project with your framework and stack. The first step is to generate an authorization URL , which is an URL on the Fief server that'll ask you for your email address and password. client.py from fief_client import Fief fief = Fief ( \"https://example.fief.dev\" , # (1)! \"YOUR_CLIENT_ID\" , # (2)! \"YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET\" , # (3)! ) redirect_url = \"http://localhost:8000/callback\" auth_url = fief . auth_url ( redirect_url , scope = [ \"openid\" ]) print ( f \"Open this URL in your browser: { auth_url } \" ) code = input ( \"Paste the callback code: \" ) tokens , userinfo = fief . auth_callback ( code , redirect_url ) print ( f \"Tokens: { tokens } \" ) print ( f \"Userinfo: { userinfo } \" ) Then, we make the script prompt for the authorization code . client.py from fief_client import Fief fief = Fief ( \"https://example.fief.dev\" , # (1)! \"YOUR_CLIENT_ID\" , # (2)! \"YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET\" , # (3)! ) redirect_url = \"http://localhost:8000/callback\" auth_url = fief . auth_url ( redirect_url , scope = [ \"openid\" ]) print ( f \"Open this URL in your browser: { auth_url } \" ) code = input ( \"Paste the callback code: \" ) tokens , userinfo = fief . auth_callback ( code , redirect_url ) print ( f \"Tokens: { tokens } \" ) print ( f \"Userinfo: { userinfo } \" ) This temporary code is generated by Fief upon successful login and can be used to obtain valid tokens. Fief returns both an access token and an ID token , which contains information about the user. client.py from fief_client import Fief fief = Fief ( \"https://example.fief.dev\" , # (1)! \"YOUR_CLIENT_ID\" , # (2)! \"YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET\" , # (3)! ) redirect_url = \"http://localhost:8000/callback\" auth_url = fief . auth_url ( redirect_url , scope = [ \"openid\" ]) print ( f \"Open this URL in your browser: { auth_url } \" ) code = input ( \"Paste the callback code: \" ) tokens , userinfo = fief . auth_callback ( code , redirect_url ) print ( f \"Tokens: { tokens } \" ) print ( f \"Userinfo: { userinfo } \" ) Test it You can run this script from a command line: python client.py You'll get the following output: Open this URL in your browser: https://example.fief.dev/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8000%2Fcallback&scope=openid Paste the callback code: You can copy and paste this URL manually in your browser .

Example auth_url = fief . auth_url ( \"http://localhost:8000/callback\" , scope = [ \"openid\" ]) auth_callback Returns valid tokens and user info in exchange of an authorization code. Parameters code: str : The authorization code. redirect_uri: str : The exact same redirect_uri you passed to the authorization URL. Example tokens , userinfo = fief . auth_callback ( \"CODE\" , \"http://localhost:8000/callback\" ) auth_refresh_token Returns fresh tokens and user info in exchange of a refresh token. Parameters refresh_token: str : A valid refresh token. scope: Optional[List[str]] = None : Optional list of scopes to ask for. If not provided, the access token will share the same list of scopes as requested the first time. Otherwise, it should be a subset of the original list of scopes. Example tokens , userinfo = fief . auth_refresh_token ( \"REFRESH_TOKEN\" ) validate_access_token Checks if an access token is valid and optionally that it has a required list of scopes. Parameters access_token: str : The access token to validate. required_scope: Optional[List[str]] = None : Optional list of scopes to check for.

It features impressive performance and top-notch developer experience. Actually, the Fief server itself is implemented with FastAPI! The Fief Python client provides tools to help you integrate Fief authentication in your FastAPI project. Let's see how to use them! Install the client Install the Fief client with the optional FastAPI dependencies: pip install \"fief-client[fastapi]\" API example This is for you if... Your FastAPI backend will work as a pure REST API. You have a separate frontend, like a JavaScript or mobile app, that'll take care of the OAuth2 flow. In this first example, we'll leverage the interactive documentation generated by FastAPI to perform the OAuth2 authentication. The goal here is just to show you how to protect your API route with a Fief access token . app.py from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI from fastapi.security import OAuth2AuthorizationCodeBearer from fief_client import FiefAccessTokenInfo , FiefAsync from fief_client.integrations.fastapi import FiefAuth fief = FiefAsync ( # (1)! \"https://example.fief.dev\" , \"YOUR_CLIENT_ID\" , \"YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET\" , ) scheme = OAuth2AuthorizationCodeBearer ( # (2)! \"https://example.fief.dev/authorize\" , \"https://example.fief.dev/api/token\" , scopes = { \"openid\" : \"openid\" , \"offline_access\" : \"offline_access\" }, ) auth = FiefAuth ( fief , scheme ) # (3)! app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/user\" ) async def get_user ( access_token_info : FiefAccessTokenInfo = Depends ( auth . current_user ()), # (4)! ): return access_token_info Fief client instantiation As we showed in the standard Python section , we instantiate here a Fief client here with the base tenant URL and client credentials. Notice here that we use the FiefAsync class. FastAPI being an ASGI framework, it's always nice to take advantage of asyncio capabilities. OpenAPI security scheme FastAPI uses those security schemes to generate an interactive documentation showing the right interface to authenticate with the API. We use here a standard OAuth2 interface. Fief helper for FastAPI This is the helper doing the tedious work for you with FastAPI. All it needs is an instance of the Fief client and the scheme. current_user dependency This is where the magic happens: in pure FastAPI style, FiefAuth gives you a current_user dependency to check for the access token and optionally for required scopes. If everything goes well, you'll get a dictionary containing the ID of the user, the list of allowed scopes and the raw access token. And that's about it! Test it You can run this example just like you would do for any FastAPI app: uvicorn app:app Open http://localhost:8000/docs to access the interactive documentation. Let's try first the /user endpoint: We get an 401 error! That's expected: we are not authenticated yet ! Let's fix that: click on the Authorize button to start the authentication process. You'll need to provide your client ID and secret and select the scopes. Click on the Authorize button: you are redirected to the Fief login page. Upon successful login, you will be redirected back to the interactive documentation: a valid access token has been generated! You can now try the /user endpoint to check the result: Notice how the interactive documentation passed the access token in the Authorization header of the request! Besides, the response does contain the user ID, the list of allowed scopes and the access token itself. Checking for scopes Building on the previous example, you can make your endpoint requires the access token to be granted a list of scopes . Simply add this list of scopes as a parameter of the current_user dependency. app.py from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI from fastapi.security import OAuth2AuthorizationCodeBearer from fief_client import FiefAccessTokenInfo , FiefAsync from fief_client.integrations.fastapi import FiefAuth fief = FiefAsync ( \"https://example.fief.dev\" , \"YOUR_CLIENT_ID\" , \"YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET\" , ) scheme = OAuth2AuthorizationCodeBearer ( \"https://example.fief.dev/authorize\" , \"https://example.fief.dev/api/token\" , scopes = { \"openid\" : \"openid\" , \"offline_access\" : \"offline_access\" }, ) auth = FiefAuth ( fief , scheme ) app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/user\" ) async def get_user ( access_token_info : FiefAccessTokenInfo = Depends ( auth . current_user ([ \"openid\" , \"required_scope\" ]) ), ): return access_token_info If one of the required scope is missing on the access token, a 403 Forbidden error will automatically be returned. Web application example This is for you if... Your FastAPI backend will render HTML pages. Your application is intended to be used in a browser. The examples we showed previously are working well in a pure REST API context: a frontend, like the interactive documentation, a JavaScript application or a mobile app will take care of the OAuth2 authentication flow to retrieve an access token before making request to your API. Another common context is traditional web application, where the server takes care of generating HTML pages before returning it to the browser. In this case, we'll need some routes to redirect the user to the Fief login page if they're not authenticated and take care of storing the access token somewhere. This is what'll show in this example. Basically, here's what we'll do: This time, we'll expect the access token to be passed through a traditional cookie instead of an HTTP header. Cookies are very convenient when designing web apps because they are handled automatically by the browser. If the cookie is not present, we'll redirect the user to the Fief login page . Once again, the browser will help us a lot here since it'll automatically follow the redirection. Upon successful login, Fief will automatically redirect the user to the callback route . This callback route will take care of setting a new cookie containing the access token . It means that the access token will be safely stored in the browser memory. Finally, the user is redirected back to the protected route. The browser will automatically send the cookie containing the access token: our request is now authenticated! app.py from datetime import datetime from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI , HTTPException , Query , Request , Response , status from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse , RedirectResponse from fastapi.security import APIKeyCookie from fief_client import FiefAccessTokenInfo , FiefAsync from fief_client.integrations.fastapi import FiefAuth class CustomFiefAuth ( FiefAuth ): # (1)! client : FiefAsync async def get_unauthorized_response ( self , request : Request , response : Response ): redirect_uri = request . url_for ( \"auth_callback\" ) # (2)! auth_url = await self . client . auth_url ( redirect_uri , scope = [ \"openid\" ]) # (3)! raise HTTPException ( status_code = status .

Your user ID is { access_token_info [ 'id' ] } </h1>\" ) We customize the FiefAuth helper to fit our needs The base class is implemented with an API scenario in mind. Nevertheless, it's designed in a way you can customize its behavior when the user is not authenticated or has not the required scope. That's what'll do with the get_unauthorized_response . We build the redirect URL This points to our /auth-callback route that we define below. We generate an authorization URL on the Fief server The base class is implemented with an API scenario in mind. Nevertheless, it's designed in a way you can customize its behavior when the user is not authenticated or has not the required scope. That's what'll do with the get_unauthorized_response . We build a redirect response By setting a status code in the 3XX range, we tell the browser that it should redirect the user to another URL, specified in the Location header. You can read more about HTTP redirections on the MDN documentation . This doesn't change from the previous example The FiefAsync client is always at the heart of the integration \ud83d\ude09 We use a scheme expecting a cookie Contrary to the previous examples, we expect the access token to be passed in a cookie. Thus, we use a dedicated scheme for that. Notice that we set the name of this cookie through the SESSION_COOKIE_NAME constant. Besides, we set the auto_error argument to False . It tells FastAPI user to bypass its built-in error response if the cookie is not present: we have our own logic to handle this. We use our custom CustomFiefAuth class Of course, now that we overloaded the behavior of this helper class, we shouldn't forget to actually use it! We implement an /auth-callback route This is the route that'll take care of exchanging the authorization code with a fresh access token and save it in a cookie. Notice that we set its name parameter: this is how we can generate its URL automatically with the request.url_for method. We generate an access token We finish the OAuth2 flow by exchanging the authorization code with a fresh access token. We build a redirection to the /protected route The user will now be correctly authenticated to our web application. Thus, we can redirect them to a protected page. We build a new cookie containing the access token The response will contain a Set-Cookie header instructing the browser to save the access token in its memory. This method allows us to configure each properties of the cookie. You can read more about HTTP cookies on the MDN documentation . Set the cookie as HTTPOnly For such sensitive values, it's strongly recommended to set the cookie as HTTPOnly . It means that it won't be possible to read its value from JavaScript, reducing potential attacks. Set the cookie as secure in production For such sensitive values, it's strongly recommended to set the cookie as Secure . It tells the browser to send the cookie only on HTTPS (SSL) connection, reducing the risk of the access token to be stolen by a attacker between the client and the server. However, in a local environment, you usually don't serve your application with SSL. That's why we set it to False in this example. A common approach to handle this is to have an environment variable to control this parameter, so you can disable it in local and enable it in production. Use the current_user dependency as usual This doesn't change from the previous example. The dependency will check if the cookie is available in the request and proceed if everything goes well. Otherwise, our custom get_unauthorized_response will be called and the user will be redirected to the Fief login page. That's it! If you run this application and go to http://localhost:8000/protected , you'll be redirected to the Fief login page and experience the authentication flow before getting back to this route with a proper authentication cookie.","title":"FastAPI"},{"location":"integrate/python/fastapi/#fastapi","text":"FastAPI is one of the fastest-growing Python web framework.

An alternative way is to use a .env file. It's a simple file where each line consists of a key and a value separated by an equal sign: .env SECRET = XXX FIEF_CLIENT_ID = XXX FIEF_CLIENT_SECRET = XXX ENCRYPTION_KEY = XXX Then, you can reference this file in the Docker command: docker run \\ --name fief-server \\ -p 8000 :80 -d \\ --env-file .env \\ ghcr.io/fief-dev/fief:latest Using Docker Compose For more complex setups, you may need to configure a Docker Compose file to help you manage all your containers. You can directly define your environment variables in the Compose file. You'll find below an example of a Docker Compose file to run the Fief server. docker-compose.yml version : \"3.9\" services : fief : image : ghcr.io/fief-dev/fief:latest ports : - \"80:8000\" environment : - SECRET=XXX - FIEF_CLIENT_ID=XXX - FIEF_CLIENT_SECRET=XXX - ENCRYPTION_KEY=XXX Reference For each variable, we'll try to provide a sensible example value to help you configure it correctly.
